                <p class="beta-text">Thanks for beta-testing, C4ADS!</p>
                <p class="beta-text">If you have any feedback about the website design, how the workflow can be improved, any cool features, or concerns about the search, please let us know <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIYem2nuEyzsIOnTPIjeOpdrGS_gls0OftNnHd-GEepQZqIg/viewform?usp=sf_link" class="real-link" target="_blank">here</a>.  We're looking mainly at workflow/interface concerns since our data is still being reworked as you read this.  However, we appreciate ALL feedback, so please submit anything you can think of!  We want to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.</p>
                <p class="beta-text">Because this is still a proof-of-concept for what the platform will look like, there are a few important caveats:</p>
                <ul class="beta-text">
                    <li>We're using an incomplete dataset, so there will be a lot of missing data (especially aliases).  We'll be swapping in a new database with all of the data soon!</li>
                    <li>We're still working on optimizing our searching!  Press release search isn't very fuzzy and sometimes SDN search returns too many results. If you encounter a search result that's just drastically wrong, please tell us what you typed into the search bar and what you were expecting as a result.  This will be hugely helpful for us as we optimize search.</li>
                    <li>Press releases are not integrated into SDN search yet -- there will be a section similar to "Linked To" where we list all possible press releases.  This should be available on Monday March 5.</li>

				<h1 class="about-header text-center">About Archer SDN</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Archer SDN reimagines the <a href="https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov">OFAC SDN List website</a>, a list of individuals, entities, and vehicles that are sanctioned by the Treasury Department.  This list is notoriously difficult to search yet plays a crucial role in foreign investigations.  We've redesigned the experience of searching the database, providing access to all of the same data with a more seamless interface and additional features to streamline the investigative process.</p>

				<p>Archer SDN was created by <a href="https://archerimpact.com">Archer</a> (a Berkeley-based nonprofit using tech to improve human rights and human security) in collaboration with <a href="https://c4ads.org">C4ADS</a> (a nonprofit data-driven think tank in D.C.).</p>

				<h1 class="about-header text-center">Features</h1>
				<hr>

				<h5 class="text-left">Better search capabilities</h5>
				<p>Unsure how a name transliterates?  Are multiple similar spellings available?  With fuzzy/inexact matching, items that might have previously gone unfound will no longer slip through the cracks.  Additionally, there are more filters available to allow for searching by other categories, so it's easier to find what you're looking for.</p>
				<hr>

				<h5 class="text-left">Press release integration</h5>
				<p>The Treasury <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/OFAC-Recent-Actions.aspx">releases additional context</a> when they update the list.  These releases are indexed &amp; searchable via the Archer SDN platform.  These press releases can even be used to search for entities who were on the SDN list at one point but were removed, since their identifying information will have been released in a press release.</p>
				<hr>

				<h5 class="text-left">Transliteration Support</h5>
                <p>OFAC has begun to include non-English names as aliases.  Unfortunately, these are neither searachable nor surfaced in the results on the OFAC website.  For entries that have transliterated names, you can view and search here.</p>
				<hr>

				<h5 class="text-left">Printable reports</h5>
				<p>Regular search queries can be printed -- simply run the print keyboard shortcut (control + P on Windows; command + P on Mac) and all of the cards on your screen will be printed.  Expand the entities of interest and their details will be included in the printout!</p>
				<hr>

				<p>There are plenty of other ways that Archer SDN stands out from the Treasury's website, including an interface that's modern, updated, and requires fewer clicks to navigate.  If you'd like to see a feature added or report a bug, please email Archer SDN@archerimpact.com.</p>
